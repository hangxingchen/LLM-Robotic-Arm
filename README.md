# LLM-Robotic-Arm
Robotic arm system powered by LLM (ChatGPT) and YOLO for voice-controlled object manipulation.
# Overview

LLM-Robotic-Arm integrates object detection (YOLO) and LLM-based natural language understanding (ChatGPT) to enable voice-guided control of a 6-DOF robotic arm. The system supports real-time object detection, socket-based communication, and inverse kinematics for precise motion execution.

# Features

- Voice-based object manipulation  
- YOLO-powered real-time object detection  
- LLM (ChatGPT/Gemini) for natural language understanding  
- Raspberry Pi-based deployment  
- Inverse kinematics and servo control
